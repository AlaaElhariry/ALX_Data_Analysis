    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. We will document our wrangling efforts, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.<br><br>\n",

Secondly, `The tweet image predictions tsv file`, which we will download programmatically. Finally, `Twitter API & JSON`."

    "The Twitter account @dog_rates is focused on rating and commenting humorously on pictures of dogs, hence the likes, retweets and ratings do not completely depend on the picture of the dogs since the humor affects the followers decision as well.<br>\n",
    "We believe we did a great job at this project, form gathering data to assessing it and cleaning it and then analyzing it. There were some problems though, for example, the missing tweet_ids that we couldn't scrape their data from Twitter. Also, the dataset definitely needs further cleaning and assessment."
